<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file dcfifo2.v </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of scfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design dcfifo2.v.  The design dcfifo2.v has a depth of 1024 words of 8 bits each. The output of the fifo is registered. The fifo is in show-ahead synchronous mode.  The data becomes available before 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read acknowledge. </P>

<P><CENTER><FONT size=2>Fig. 2 : Wave showing FIFO full operation. </CENTER></P>
<P><FONT size=3>The above waveform shows the behavior of the design for FIFO full condition. In the example above, data is written into the FIFO till it is full, then data is read back. </P>
