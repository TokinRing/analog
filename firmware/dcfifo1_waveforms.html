<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file dcfifo1.v </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of scfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design dcfifo1.v. The design dcfifo1.v has a depth of 128 words of 32 bits each. The output of the fifo is registered. The fifo is in show-ahead synchronous mode. The data becomes available before 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read acknowledge. </P>
