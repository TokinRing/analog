<h2><CENTER>Sample behavioral waveforms for design file dcfifo4.v </CENTER></h2>
<P>The following waveforms show the behavior of scfifo megafunction for the chosen set of parameters in design dcfifo4.v. The design dcfifo4.v has a depth of 512 words of 64 bits each. The output of the fifo is registered. The fifo is in show-ahead synchronous mode. The data becomes available before 'rdreq' is asserted; 'rdreq' acts as a read acknowledge. </P>
